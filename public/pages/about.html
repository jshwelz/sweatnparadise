  <p>Sweat n' Paradise is our way to show people The beautiful island of Roatan, SNP is all about fitness and disconnecting from your world to connect with your body. While we stick to the philosophy of training hard, we also want for everyone to have a good time, get to know the island and meet new people that share the same passion for conditioning as you. That's why as part of the experience, we offer to take you places that are not normally visited.</p>

  <p>Between Functional training, Weightlifting and Cardio the program that we designed in Sweat n' Paradise comes down to  a basic concept: Strength and mobility. </p>
